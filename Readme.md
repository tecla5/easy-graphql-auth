# Auth0 integration libs for GraphQL clients and servers

Makes it quick and easy to setup GraphQL servers such as [GraphCool](https://www.graph.cool) with [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) and *GraphQL* clients, such as:

- [apollo](https://github.com/apollographql)
- [lokka](https://github.com/kadirahq/lokka)

See the docs for each of the modules included for more details including installation and usage. Enjoy!!

These libs can be used in combination with the recently updated tutorial project [micro-stripe-example](https://github.com/tecla5/micro-stripe-example) for payments.

Coming soon: *Stripe subscription payments integration*

> Vue2 with GraphCool and Auth0

Demo app showcasing `gc-auth0-apollo` and `gc-auth0-lokka` with Vue 2.

## Commands

You can replace `yarn` with `npm run` here.

```bash
# build for production
yarn build

# development mode
yarn dev

# serve the bundled dist folder in production mode
yarn serve
```


## Progress Web App

Your app is now offline-ready (only in production bundle), which means you can visit it without network.

Here we use a default [manifest.json](./static/manifest.json) to configurure your pwa, for example, to enable [Add to Home Screen] feature on Android. It will be copied directly to `./dist/manifest.json`.


For all the available options, please head to [poi-preset-offline](https://github.com/egoist/poi/tree/master/packages/poi-preset-offline#api).
